# Constantly compelled to create with code.

From childhood until today I have always been driven to learn new programming languages.
At the early age of 8, I began copying BASIC programs into the computer, and making simple choice-based games.
It was no surprise that my interests turned to making games in Flash.

In college, I chose a bachelors program in interactive media design where I created games and interactive experiences in in Flash and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io).

Since then I've had my hands in many languages, but my favorites today are Clojure and Javascript.
