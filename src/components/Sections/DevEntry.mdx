# <FontAwesomeIcon icon="hammer" /> A Jack of all Trades. 

My experience with development spans many languages and technologies across the last 15 years.
Javascript and Clojure are my two most used languages which I have used across several full-stack projects.

I'm also well versed in blockchain tech, specifically Ethereum <FontAwesomeIcon icon={['fab', 'ethereum']}/> and Decentralized Finance applications like Dharma Protocol. <FontAwesomeIcon icon="chart-line" />


I'm currently looking to join a team as a web developer. <FontAwesomeIcon icon="coffee"/>

Please [get in touch](mailto:modulations@gmail.com) if you have an opportunity to discuss!
